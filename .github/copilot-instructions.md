# AI / Automated Agent Instructions

1. **NO AUTOMATED COMMITS**: Under no circumstances should an AI agent or script commit code to this repository automatically.
2. **NO AUTOMATED PUSHES**: Never push to `main` or any branch without explicit, confirmed user command.
3. **READ-ONLY GIT**: All git operations performed by agents must be read-only (e.g., `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`).
